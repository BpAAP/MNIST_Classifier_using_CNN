# MNIST Classifier using CNN

## Overview
Project for classifying numerical digits using a convolutional neural network. The network was trained with Keras in Python and converted to a TensorflowJS model for demonstration.

## Demonstration
This repository is mirrored in a Glitch project, you can try it out at:

## Training
The model used in the demo was trained with Keras in Python on Google's free Collab platform using GPU acceleration. You can view and run the annotated code here:

## JavaScript App
The JavaScript app loads the saved model from this github and allows you to draw and classify digits in-browser with all processing done client-side.
